## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The package can be installed on any local python environment with pip install .

Apart from the standard installation with Anaconda, the package IPython may need to be installed separatly.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I want to showcase how to create a python package from scratch on the example of different bar plots.

That's to demonstrate the benefits of object oriented programming in writing programs that include multiple classes and it's practical application to real world data science problems in any company.

Further to showcase clean, modular and well-documented code examples which greatly benefit collaboration.

## File Descriptions
There are python files including all the files that are necessary to run the code. Also there is the setup file to run pip install and the init to load the distribution classes.
